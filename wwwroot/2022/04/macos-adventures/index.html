</h4><p>I&rsquo;ve always liked <del>OSX</del> MacOS, dating back to when we had iMac G1s (and later G4s) in our school computer lab.</p>
<p><img src="/2022/04/macos_adventures/imac-g4-imac-g3-comparison.jpg" alt="iMac G1 in Aqua"></p>
<p>Remember those? They were really nice. We should go back.</p>
<p>Back when I was in uni I used some suuuuper sketchy patched installers to run Mavericks (iirc) on my FX-4350 based system.
Back then documentation was nonexistent, you had to read through scammy-looking forums for answers, etc etc etc bullshit.
But you know what? It worked. It worked surprisingly well. I even played quite a bit of Team Fortress 2 on it.
For whatever reason I eventually I switched to Arch+KDE4 (remember tabbing together arbitrary windows?), but I&rsquo;ve always fondly remembered those osx days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what inspired me to try running <del>OSX</del> MacOS this time around, but I&rsquo;m very happy to report that the situation has improved quite a bit.
It&rsquo;s like adults have taken over the whole ecosystem. Most things are documented, everything is on Github instead of totally-not-a-virus.com, etc.</p>
<p>My current build is a 5600x with an rx580 (wanna sell me something better at msrp?). I certainly didn&rsquo;t plan this build for macos, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if I can&rsquo;t get it working.
After all, if I could do it when I was dumb enough to go to uni, I should be able to do it now, right?</p>

</h3><p>My plan at first was to install Monterey as a vm on <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve">Proxmox VE</a>.
I&rsquo;ve been using PVE for years both at work and on my personal iron, and I&rsquo;m no stranger to PCI passthrough, so I figured this would be a cinch.
<a href="https://www.nicksherlock.com/2021/10/installing-macos-12-monterey-on-proxmox-7/">This guide</a> made it look pretty easy, and it was.</p>
<p>GPU passthrough was straightforward. Enable iommu, setup some vfio stuff, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the almost effortless gpu passthough, I passed through the usb3 controllers. <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way this works, right?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It did. It literally justwerked™, no kexts or device-id changes required.</p>
<p>Apparently Apple likes AMD these days? Or maybe these usb3 controllers are uh, class compliant? Is that even a thing for things that live in the chipset?</p>
<p>In the past I&rsquo;ve had good luck switching between different Windows and Linux vms, moving the gpu around in a digital game of hot potato.
Knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t really be able to game on MacOS no matter how stronk my hardware, I had this workflow pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monterey, Windows, and Linux (possibly multiple, more below) vms on the same host</li>
<li>Suspend-to-disk the current vm</li>
<li>Switch to a different vm</li>
<li>The gpu gets released by the old vm and picked up by the new one</li>
<li>It all justwerks, I don&rsquo;t have to do a full reboot, and because I&rsquo;m suspending to disk, I don&rsquo;t even have to re-open all my programs!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s never quite as easy as you think it will be.
In my case, it <em>almost</em> completely worked.
Going from MacOS -&gt; (Linux, Windows) worked perfectly (after I installed the <a href="https://github.com/gnif/vendor-reset">Vendor Reset kernel module</a>).</p>
<p>Going back to Monterey though&hellip; Didn&rsquo;t work. MacOS just wouldn&rsquo;t pick up and reactivate the gpu. Sadface.</p>
<p>I was also faced with the vm not grabbing the gpu on first startup. I had to do this each time the host booted, and it was annoying:</p>
<p><code>qm start 3001 &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; qm stop 3001 &amp;&amp; sleep 5 &amp;&amp; qm start 3001</code></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure someone could figure it all out, but I&rsquo;m not a hardware hacker by any means (the last time I wrote C was pen on paper in CS101).</p>
<p>I had gotten a fresh taste of the MacOS life, and I wasn&rsquo;t going to settle for Windows or Open Sores on my desktop.
It was time for a different plan.</p>

</h3><p>Knowing that I was getting pretty deep into the black magik voodoo tier of host/guest interaction, I decided to take a step back.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that bad restarting programs, it&rsquo;s really just a few terminal windows and discord, I guess we can do a true multi-boot&hellip;
Yeah performance inside the vm is okay, but I want native power management and stuff like that.
Might as well install on iron.</em></p>
<p>Reality checked, I did a quick <code>zfs send | ssh root@maelcum zfs recv</code> to save my Monterey vm on my nas just in case I had to go back, and started actually reading OpenCore&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>First things first, we need some install media for MacOS. The guide recommends starting with Big Sur or something old like that.
Here at goos.blog, we don&rsquo;t use old software, ever. Hardware, sure, that&rsquo;s just cheaper. But all software is free (if you try hard enough), so why use old things?</p>
<p>Remembering how long it took the macos netinstall to run from a minimal boot usb, I created a full one.
It took well over three hours (a good hour longer than the netinstall took on the vm) to download and flash to a reasonably good usb3 thumbdrive from inside the vm. Second sadface.
That was the easy part.</p>
<p>Not that any of this was particularly hard, but that was the easy part.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the boredom of going through the opencore configuration, if you&rsquo;re trying to do this you should be reading the documentation, not a blog post.
I ended up booting a livecd on my laptop to run ProperTree because I still cba to figure out how to mount an esp on Windows.
It didn&rsquo;t take much for me to get to a working installer, some kexts here, some patches there, about 10 roundtrips back into the vm to make edits, and here we go!
Oh&hellip; Wait&hellip; Why aren&rsquo;t any of my disks showing up?</p>
<p>Like always, I had forgotten something.
This time around the &ldquo;something&rdquo; was an entire section of the documentation detailing how some sata controllers aren&rsquo;t supported and need an additional kernel extension.
Easy fix, just annoying that I had glazed over yet another thing.</p>
<p>At this point it was 5am (from the wrong direction). I went to bed.</p>

</h3><p>I awoke at noon, somewhat refreshed, still buzzing on the &ldquo;did a cool thing&rdquo; high.</p>
<p>Going into my office, I see that the desktop is in s3 sleep. <em>&ldquo;Huh, didn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;d work out of the box&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I tap ctrl a few times and to my delight the system wakes up and I&rsquo;m presented with a login screen.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to get things setup. Firefox, plex, vscode, my various email accounts (apple mail &gt; outlook / thunderbird), and I&rsquo;m good to go.
I do most of my development and testing work in vms on armitage, my stronk dual socket system with lots of wam and ssd, so my actual dev envs are pretty portable.</p>

</h3><p>As I type this on the Monterey side of my desktop <em>&hellip;tabs over to ebay tracking and hits refresh&hellip;</em>
I&rsquo;m waiting on another RX580 to come in the mail. This one is going to go into armitage (dell t7910) and is going to be used for a <em><strong>GAMING SERVER</strong></em>
(I&rsquo;ve been jealous of <a href="https://lo.calho.st/posts/gaming-vm/">tmick0&rsquo;s setup</a> ever since I pointed him in the right directions on it).
Like him, I use a steam link on my teevee, and I&rsquo;ll also be able to stream games to my desktop.
Once that&rsquo;s setup the only time I&rsquo;ll have to leave macos is for playing CS:GO - it <em>runs</em> on macos, but uh&hellip; shittily.
I have grand ideas for a boot-to-csgo linux install, we&rsquo;ll see if I find a roundtuit for that project.</p>
<p>Was it all worth it?</p>
<p>Yes (even though I&rsquo;ve spent $700 in the past two days on more wam and a gpu for armitage).</p>
<p>Could I have just stuck with winderp or installed a linux?</p>
<p>Sure. But where&rsquo;s the fun in that?</p>
