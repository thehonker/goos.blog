#### *you should start a nerd blog man - tmick0, 2022*

And so here we are. Furthering the pollution of the web with more nerd shit.

After about 5 minutes of searching I settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Anubis](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme.

I like that it takes markdown and renders it into static html, even if the output is a little gross.

```bash
brew install hugo
mkdir -p ~/Documents/repos/goos.blog
cd ~/Documents/repos/goos.blog
hugo new site hugo
hugo server -D &
vscode .
```

Who am I? I'm just a dude, man. Doing my thing, typing my commands, sailing my boat.
