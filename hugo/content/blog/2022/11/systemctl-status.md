#### *don't quit your dayjob*

Some updates:

- I bought a 93 Miata, and was able to drive it for all of two weeks before the snow hit
- I orderd an android based head unit for either the ranger or the miata
- I bought hardware for a BLE app-drive camera shutter release / intervalometer
- I was given a 2nd gen iPad to use for MagicMirror and had to do some fun things to get it working
- I bought a chromebook, codename `kevin`, and am writing build tools for it
  - Yes, Cadmium exists, and yes I did use it to build a working ubuntu image
- I'm weeks if not days away from quitting my dayjob
  - I plan to take some time away from having a dayjob to work on projects
  - I have 1099 work to keep me solvent for now
