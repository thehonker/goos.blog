#### *I really need a new dayjob*

Don't worry, loyal blag-o-blag readers. \
I haven't forgotten about you.

I've just been. Not busy. Not not-busy. In busy limbo, I guess.

The na6 is running great and I've been installing all the dumb mods that you do to a miata:

- coolant reroute
- oil filter relocate
- clutch line
- brake lines

Both boats sit in the same place they started winter in. \
Pretty sad, they're going to get some love soon hopefully.

The job search has begun in earnest. The resume canon has been fired several times now. If you're looking for a nerd to hire, drop me a line.

I'm writing blog posts again. \
I'm finishing up one about that chromebook I bought, and I have a few others started.

Stay tuned, point your rss reader [here](https://goos.blog/index.xml), and keep an eye on the skies.
