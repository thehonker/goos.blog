#### *I got a job!*

Hello loyal readers. I haven't been writing much here lately,
but then to be fair I haven't been doing any cool nerd shit lately.

Back in August of '23 I finally got a new job, for a staffing agency, working for a big name cloud provider.
In November they converted me into a real boy, and I haven't looked back.

Getting back into the swing of things took a while. But here I am again.

I'm doing nerd shit again. I'm planning a complete overhaul of my home network and all services I provide out of my closet.

Expect a bunch of posts about that. I ordered a trio of Lenovo P330 Tiny boxen, and I'm planning on some wacky things with k8s, kubevirt, and opnsense (maybe involving sr-iov). Stay tuned.
